## Project title

Movie Recommender (tbd)

## Description

In today’s digital world, recommendation systems are crucial for suggesting relevant content to users, from movies to products. Our project aims to build a movie recommender system tailored for group settings. Specifically, when multiple people input their favourite movies, the system will suggest a new movie that everyone should enjoy.

By leveraging IMDb’s and Movielens dataset, which includes a wealth of information on movie ratings, genres, directors, and other metadata, we aim to build a robust system that takes into account the diverse tastes of users and provides accurate recommendations.
